<p>The Conquer template is a really great starting place for new learners. They have the opportunity to build something they can feel proud of while still being challenged. The Conquer template utilizes bootstrap, but it is important to avoid using this to build the project.
    This template offers many different layouts and challenges that a web developer may encounter in the real world. This forces new learners to think for themselves and delve into new technologies like flex box and floats to gain confidence in CSS layout techniques. Adding an element of Responsiveness is a stretch goal for this project that will really let the developer flex their muscles!</p>
